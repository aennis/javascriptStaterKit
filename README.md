Ah, JavaScript. It's so easy to get started. Wait, no it's not, it's overwhelming. 
Now sure, today, more of us are writing JavaScript than ever before, 
and if you've been coding for long, you may recognize the value of testing, linting, bundling, transpiling, automated builds, and more, 
but all too often, we ignore many of these items. Why? Because setting up a solid JavaScript development environment is so much work. 
The list of choices is so long and complex that it's hard to know even where to get started. Hi, I'm Cory House, and I'm here to help. 
I've been building rich web applications in JavaScript for over 15 years now, and frankly I'm tired of starting from scratch. 
So in this course, I propose a solution. What if your team had a powerful, rapid feedback development environment? 
What if every time you started a new project, you had a solid foundation that supported automated testing, bundling, linting, 
transpiling, error logging, and so much more out of the box? That's the goal of this course. Let's stop starting from scratch. 
Let's build a JavaScript starter kit so your team can rapidly get started and enjoy all the benefits of a modern, powerful, 
and automated development experience. A great JavaScript development environment makes doing the right thing the easy thing.
